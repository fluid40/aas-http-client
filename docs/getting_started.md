```yaml
{
    "base_url": "http://myaasserver:5043/",   # The base url of the aas server. E.g. 'http://www.myaasserver.de/' or 'http://myaasserver:5043/api/v3.0'
    "username": "",                           # username for authentication (optional)
    "https_proxy": null,                      # HTTPS settings for proxy (optional)
    "http_proxy": null,                       # HTTP settings for proxy (optional)
    "time_out": 10,                           # Timeout for single API calls in seconds (optional, default is '200')
    "connection_time_out": 10,                # Timeout when establishing the connection from the client to the server (optional, default is '100')
    "ssl_verify": True                        # Verification of TLS/SSL certificates when establishing an connection (optional, default is 'True')
